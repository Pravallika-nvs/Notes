            <h2>7. Types of Pumps</h2>
            <p>Pumps are mechanical devices used to move fluids from one place to another.</p>
            <p>They can be classified into two main types: Positive Displacement Pumps and Centrifugal Pumps.</p>
            <h3>7.1 Positive Displacement Pumps</h3>
            <p>Positive displacement pumps move fluid by trapping a fixed amount and forcing it into the discharge pipe.</p>
            <p>They are of two types: Reciprocating and Rotary Pumps</p>
            <h4>7.1.1 Reciprocating Pumps</h4>
            <p>Reciprocating pumps use a piston to move fluid in and out of a cylinder. They work on to-and-fro motion.</p>
            <p>Examples include Piston pumps and plunger pumps.</p>
            <h4>7.1.2 Rotary Pumps</h4>
            <p>Rotary pumps use rotating mechanisms to move fluid. They work on a continuous motion.</p>
            <p>Examples include Gear pumps and Mono pumps.</p>
            <p>Gear pumps are used for high-viscosity fluids like grease, or heavy oil fractions.</p>
            <h3>7.2 Centrifugal Pumps</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Use centrifugal force to convert kinetic energy into pressure energy.</li>
            <li>Based on: Kinet</li>
            <li>Suitable for general liquid pumping.</li>
            <li>Includes Foot Valve at inlet (like a mesh) to block debris and Impeller (blade-like component) – rotates to push fluid smoothly.</li>
            </ul>
